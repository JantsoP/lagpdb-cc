            Hey @${{ github.actor }}!
            First of all, thank you for your pull request, however I noticed that you want to merge it into the default branch, `master`.
            As only thoroughly tested code appears on this repository's default branch, please change the base branch to `dev`, as [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) states:
            > Please open all of your pull requests against the `dev` branch

            Thanks in advance and happy hacking!
