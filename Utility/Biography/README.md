There are two options for handling this one: 

Option one is to have one command that checks if the user already has an introduction, and put the one that deletes it on leave in the other.

Option two is to have one command that both checks if they already have an intro and also handles deleting on leave, but then putting ```execCC``` in the leave message.

There are also two options for choosing which version of the introduction will be deleted. 

Option one is when the old message gets deleted and the new message stays.

Option two is when the _new_ message gets deleted and the _old_ message stays.
