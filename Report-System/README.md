# Report System
These commands are **not** standalone. Add all the commands if you wish to use them.

These CCs allow you to create a report system with the ability for users to request cancellation/nullification of their reports and add some functionalities for staff utilizing reactions.
All neccessary information is arranged in an embed which is edited accordingly.

Should you need further information because something is unclear, or want to report a bug, feel free to open an issue, or follow the invite on my profile.

---
Both versions add some more functionality to the native report command, such as larger logs (250 Messages instead of 100), a report history, Notifications, and more!  
Add all custom commands in each respective folder if you wish to use them.  
**The files are not interchangeable; If you want to upgrade, readd them one by one.**
