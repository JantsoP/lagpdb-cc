## Adding these Custom Commands

This assumes you know how to create a custom command, if you aren't too familiar with that or just need a refresher, [this article](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/the-custom-command-interface) explains it well.

This repository is separated into categories. Some custom commands are standalone, there are, however, also "systems" which require you to add all scripts - They will be collected in an individual folder, to signal that, as well as accompanied by a `README.md` file documenting the installation process and usage of said system.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger value. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

1.   The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any difficulties caused by these custom commands.
These commands are not guaranteed to be working, use them at your own risk.

2.   When altering a script beyond reasonable modifications, so that it can no longer be confidently correlated to the base design, it is to be understood as predominantly being the user's design and may not receive further support.

3.   All scripts in this repository are provided as found, in a manner by which they are not meant to cause offense of any kind.

### Leading Comment

As quite a lot of effort goes into creating these custom commands, please credit the author of each script. For that, there is a leading comment, which not only discloses the author, source and license, but also gives you crucial information about the usage and functionality of this custom command. You're doing yourself a favour with keeping it in.
