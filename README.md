# About this repository
A small little collection of some high quality, well documented custom commands for the Discord bot [YAGPDB.xyz](https://www.yagpdb.xyz "YAGPDB.xyz homepage") made by [Jonas747](https://github.com/jonas747 "Jonas747's profile on GitHub").
This is not an official repository, however I plan on PRing some CCs to [the official one](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc "official yagpdb CC repository") in the far, far future.

## About these commands
When you found your way here, I assume that you already have some basic CC knowledge (how to add them, you maybe even wrote your first basic ones). Yet I still try to make it as clear as possible how to use them. If you have any improvements to suggest, or need help, feel free to either open an issue or PR.
## Something broke?
If something broke, shoot me a ping in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/0vYlUK2XBKldPSMY) (you must read the faq in order to gain write access to the server!). Alternatively, you can join [my server](https://discord.gg/tFhxypKcvm). 

Provide screenshots of the input and the error message, that way I can pinpoint it down faster!
Did you delete the error message? Log the channel and try to retrieve it back, or look at the settings of the erroring custom command, you'll find the latest error there. The more context, the better.

## Various
Nothing much to say, actually. Whenever I think a custom command of mine is worth sharing, you'll find it here pretty much soon after implementation on my server. I follow the git flow branching model and still call it master.
