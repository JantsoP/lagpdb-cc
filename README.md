<p align="center">A small collection of CCs for your server</p>

## Adding these custom commands
This assumes you already have basic knowledge of custom commands and how they function. If not, you should definitely check [the learning page](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/) out!

Some custom commands are not standalone, but this will be pointed out in the folder's individual `README.md`. Each custom command will have a leading comment explaining what it does and what trigger type and trigger are recommended.
