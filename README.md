# About this repository
My own little collection of all the custom commands (CCs) I wrote for the Discord-Bot [YAGPDB.xyz](https://www.yagpdb.xyz) ([repo](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb)) made by [Jonas747](https://github.com/jonas747).
This is not an official repository, however I plan on PRing some CCs to [the official one](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc) soon.

## About these commands
When you found your way here, I assume that you already have some basic CC knowledge (how to add them, you maybe even wrote your first basic ones). Yet I still try to make it as clear as possible how to use them. If you have any improvements to suggest, or need help, feel free to open either an issue or a PR ðŸ˜‰.

## Something broke! HELP!!!
If something broke (or seems as if), ping me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/0vYlUK2XBKldPSMY), or just join and DM me. 
### BUT:
* Tell me where you are coming from. Usually I instantly block unsolicited DMs.
* Give me screenshots. Without screenshots, I do not know what broke.
    * You deleted the error message? Well, sucks. Try to retrieve it somewhere.
* Tell me what you did. If it is a bug, I may be able to reproduce it.
