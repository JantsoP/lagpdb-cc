<p align="center">A curated collection of CCs for your server</p>

## Adding these custom commands
This assumes you already have basic knowledge of custom commands and how they function. If not, you should definitely check [the learning page](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/) out!

Some custom commands are not standalone, but this will be pointed out in the folder's individual `README.md`. Each custom command will have a leading comment explaining what it does and what trigger type and trigger I recommend. If you *really* know what you are doing, you *may* change it, but I honestly cannot recommend that.

## What custom commands do you have?
(This list will be updated soon™️)

+ [Report System](https://github.com/Olde7325/lagpdb-cc/tree/main/Report-System)
    - Set logging channel where the reports are being logged into
    - Notify users about their actions being taken on their reports
        - Set "talk-to-staff-channel" where users are being notified and can talk to the moderators
    - Edit report message to the current state (e.g. "under investigation")
    - Use reactions as menu options

*This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it meant to be. See the individual folders for details.*

## Contributing
If you spot an error, feel free to open a PR or open an issue.
If you wish to add your own command, feel free to open a PR aswell. Note that I planned this repo for my personal custom commands which I make publicly available, so not all commands will be addded.

## Disclaimer (aka legal shit nobody takes the time to actually read)
The YAGPDB creator, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any difficulties caused by these custom commands.
These commands are not guaranteed to be working (although I tested them).

## Still need help?
If you are having difficulties/issues with one of my custom commands, please feel free to DM me on Discord (tag is `Olde#7325`) or ping me in the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.gg/5uVyq2E) (the latter is recommended).
