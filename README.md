## Adding these Custom Commands

This assumes you know how to create a custom command, if you aren't too familiar with that or just need a refresher, [this article](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/the-custom-command-interface) explains it well.

This repository is separated into categories. Some custom commands are standalone, there are, however, also "systems" which require you to add all scripts - They will be collected in an individual folder, to signal that, as well as accompanied by a `README.md` file documenting the installation process and usage of said system.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger value. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute in any way, please make sure to read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first, it will explain what you need to do!

After you've read the guidelines, fork the repository, make your changes and open a pull request.

## Important
As quite a lot of effort goes into creating these custom commands, please credit the author of each script. For that, there is a leading comment (which also explains usage of the custom command), so please keep it in there (unless you are specifically told to remove it).
