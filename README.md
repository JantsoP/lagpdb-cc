## About this repository
A collection of high quality and well documented custom commands to be used in your server.
These custom commands only work for the discord bot [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz), as they were exclusively written for that specific bot. They might look they would work with MEE6, howevever they **do not.**

## Important
As quite a lot of work is put into the creation of a custom command, starting from the very idea to the final product, please show some appreciation by sharing and maybe starring this repository and keeping the leading comment in the custom command response:

```
    Author: Luca Z. <https://github.com/l-zeuch>
    License: APGL-3.0
    Copyright: (c) 2021
```
> Proper credit will be given should the author differ.

Should you not find such a block in the leading comment, you are free to use it without restrictions and limitations.

### How does the License work?
The [license](LICENSE) is the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. As that is quite a long name, people decided that the short version is `AGPL-3.0`, as seen in the small block above.

This is the TL;DR version of this license:

* You may use it for commerical use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.
* You must state license and license holder (that would be AGPL-3.0 and the author of the custom command).
* You must disclose the source (this repository).
* You must redistribute the software under the same license.
* You must state changes made to the software.
* I am not liable for any damage.
* I am not giving any warranty on the custom commands.

> Although the last two points are technically how this license works, I give a limited warranty on a working and safe custom command.

## Adding a custom commands
1. Go to the [dashboard](https://yagpdb.xyz/manage), log in, select your server.
2. Navigate to `Core > Custom commands`
3. Create a new custom command
4. Follow the setup as described in the heading comment of each custom command script you find here.

> This can also be found in [the learning resources](https://learn.yagpdb.xyz/the-custom-command-interface).

## Documentation
Each custom command has a leading comment in its code, they document the recommended trigger and trigger type as well as feature a small description of the custom command.<br/>
Should it be a package of custom commands, these will be in one folder with a `README.md` documenting the procress you have to go through to set this system up.

If you want to contribute to documenting custom command packages, go ahead, fork the repository and submit a pull request.
## Various
Nothing much left, honestly.

This repository follows for the larger part the git flow branching model, and the main branch is still called master.<br/>
You won't find many custom commands, however those which are here are, in my opinion, quite useful and (hopefully) well documented.
