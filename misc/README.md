This folder contains various custom commands, each of which using up only one slot.
Feel free to browse a bit in the files, as these will contain a description in the leading comment, as usual.

## List of contained custom commands
### Bookmark/Reaction Bookmark
A custom command which functions like an instant reminder or personal pins. It sends an embed in your DMs with YAGPDB containing a message you choose, the source channel and a jump-link to the context of that message.

Nothing much, but might come in handy. For the reaction bookmark add the Discord emoji ðŸ”– `:bookmark:` as reaction. You can of course change it, if you want to :^)
